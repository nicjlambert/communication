The goal of communication is to provide a template for reproducible 
exploratory data analysis.

## Installation

You can install the released version of communication from [Github](https://github.com/) with:

1. You need to install the devtools package. You can do this from CRAN. Invoke R and then type

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
``` 
2. Load the devtools package.

``` r
library(devtools)
```

3. In most cases, you just use install_github("author/package"). For example, with my R/communication package, which exists at github.com/nicjlambert/communication, youâ€™d type

``` r
install_github("nicjlambert/communication")
```
