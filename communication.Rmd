## Solution statement

## Everything else



```{r cars}

data_adult <-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guru99-edu/R-Programming/master/adult.csv")
```

### Check continuous variables

```{r}

continuous <-select_if(data_adult, is.numeric)
summary(continuous)

```

```{r}


test <- function(){
  
  if(params$interactive == TRUE){
    
  print('This is triggered by the interactive param being set to TRUE')
    
} else {
  
  print('This is triggered by the interactive param being set to FALSE')
}
  
}

test()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
