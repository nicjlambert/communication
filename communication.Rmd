## Problem statement

## Solution statement

## Everything else

### Cars dataset

```{r cars}

summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}


test <- function(){
  
  if(params$interactive == TRUE){
    
  print('This is triggered by the interactive param being set to TRUE')
    
} else {
  
  print('This is triggered by the interactive param being set to FALSE')
}
  
}

test()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
